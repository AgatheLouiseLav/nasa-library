# Nasa Library

## About this project

Nasa Library is a solo project. It is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) CRUD web app. There are three different APIs from the [NASA Website](https://api.nasa.gov/) and my own API for the CRUD functionality. Every user can create a personal account by signing up and logging in. This website serves as a small NASA library, presenting the following features on the homepage: APOD (Astronomical Picture Of the Day), data on asteroids close to Earth, Mars images from _Curiosity_, supernova data and images, and an observations page for making personal notes.

8. Nasa APIs.

## Challenges

It was more difficult than I thought.I wasn't able to implement any of the IceBox features for my project. I was able to create my MVP, but as the week went by, I had to make the project a bit lighter to stay on track. The CRUD functionality was challenging, yet it was the best part of the project as I got to learn more about React. It also provided good practice with MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.

## Future Opportunities

Complete all the items in the IceBox of my Trello board, such as:

	* Adding a spinner/loader while fetching data from the API.
	* Implementing pagination for the Supernova and Asteroid pages.
	* Adding a functionality to download images.
	* Creating a search bar for the NASA library to filter NASA data and render search results.
 	* Implementing media queries (some parts of the website are already responsive, but the Navbar is not).
